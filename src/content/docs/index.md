**folio.md** is a self-hosted docs site you own completely. Add it as a dependency to your project, point it at your docs folder, and ship. No managed platform, no per-seat pricing, no lock-in.

# What's included

- **Accessible by default**: semantic HTML, ARIA landmarks on every region, full keyboard navigation, and screen-reader labels on all interactive elements and external links, with no configuration required
- **Google Analytics**: add your measurement ID to `folio.config.ts` and folio.md wires it up automatically
- **GDPR-ready**: a cookie consent banner appears automatically when you configure analytics; events only fire after the visitor accepts. No third-party CMP needed.
- **Sidebar navigation**: auto-generated from your file tree; nested folders become collapsible sections with optional `_section.md` metadata
- **Full-text search**: client-side via [Fuse.js](https://www.fusejs.io), zero-latency, no external service
- **Mermaid diagrams**: rendered to SVG at build time in light and dark variants, no JS payload at runtime
- **Syntax highlighting**: via Shiki, with copy-to-clipboard on every block
- **Light & dark themes**: independently turn on or off each; gradient backgrounds configurable per theme
- **SEO-ready**: Open Graph, Twitter card, canonical URLs, robots meta, JSON-LD structured data
- **MDX support**: every page is a `.md` or `.mdx` file; MDX pages can import and render React components
- **Link validation**: folio.md checks internal links at build time and fails the build on broken links
- **Page aliases**: redirect one URL to another with a single `alias:` frontmatter field
